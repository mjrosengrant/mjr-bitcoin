Our product was inspired by the incredible power of Bitcoin. 

In coming decades, Bitcoin is going to revolutionize everything about our economy. Institutions that have stood for centuries are being completely reshaped. The rules are changing.

Our goal is to build a product that allows entrepreneurs to create new and innovative business models only possible in a Bitcoin economy. While older business models (music industry, taxi services) become obsolete, we need begin looking ahead to see which models will allow business to thrive in a cashless future.

Sandy Transactions is all about fine-grained charging. A benefit of Bitcoin is that small amounts of money can be transferred without the burden of bank fees. Users can now get charged multiple times for smaller purchases instead of committing to one lump sum. This concept can be the jumping off point for endless business schemes simply not possible prior to Bitcoin.
